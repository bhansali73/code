      Return the lowest index at which a value (second argument) should be
      inserted into an array (first argument) once it has been sorted. The
      returned value should be a number.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, getIndexToIns([1,2,3,4], 1.5) should return 1 because it is
      greater than 1 (index 0), but less than 2 (index 1).
    </p>

    <p>
      Likewise, getIndexToIns([20,3,5], 19) should return 2 because once the
      array has been sorted it will look like [3,5,20] and 19 is less than 20
      (index 2) and greater than 5 (index 1).
