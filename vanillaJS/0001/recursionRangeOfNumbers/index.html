    <h1>Use Recursion to Create a Range of Numbers</h1>
    <p>
      Continuing from the previous challenge, we provide you another opportunity
      to create a recursive function to solve a problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      We have defined a function named rangeOfNumbers with two parameters. The
      function should return an array of integers which begins with a number
      represented by the startNum parameter and ends with a number represented
      by the endNum parameter. The starting number will always be less than or
      equal to the ending number. Your function must use recursion by calling
      itself and not use loops of any kind. It should also work for cases where
      both startNum and endNum are the same.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Your function should return an array.</li>

      <li>
        Your code should not use any loop syntax (for or while or higher order
        functions such as forEach, map, filter, or reduce).
      </li>

      <li>
        rangeOfNumbers should use recursion (call itself) to solve this
        challenge.
      </li>

      <li>rangeOfNumbers(1, 5) should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].</li>

      <li>rangeOfNumbers(6, 9) should return [6, 7, 8, 9].</li>

      <li>rangeOfNumbers(4, 4) should return [4].</li>
    </ul>
