    <h1>Use the map Method to Extract Data from an Array</h1>
    <p>
      So far we have learned to use pure functions to avoid side effects in a
      program. Also, we have seen the value in having a function only depend on
      its input arguments.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is only the beginning. As its name suggests, functional programming
      is centered around a theory of functions.
    </p>

    <p>
      It would make sense to be able to pass them as arguments to other
      functions, and return a function from another function. Functions are
      considered first class objects in JavaScript, which means they can be used
      like any other object. They can be saved in variables, stored in an
      object, or passed as function arguments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's start with some simple array functions, which are methods on the
      array object prototype. In this exercise we are looking at
      Array.prototype.map(), or more simply map.
    </p>

    <p>
      The map method iterates over each item in an array and returns a new array
      containing the results of calling the callback function on each element.
      It does this without mutating the original array.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the callback is used, it is passed three arguments. The first
      argument is the current element being processed. The second is the index
      of that element and the third is the array upon which the map method was
      called.
    </p>

    <p>
      See below for an example using the map method on the users array to return
      a new array containing only the names of the users as elements. For
      simplicity, the example only uses the first argument of the callback.
    </p>

    <p>
      const users = [ { name: 'John', age: 34 }, { name: 'Amy', age: 20 }, {
      name: 'camperCat', age: 10 } ];
    </p>

    <p>
      const names = users.map(user => user.name); console.log(names); The
      console would display the value [ 'John', 'Amy', 'camperCat' ].
    </p>

    <p>
      The watchList array holds objects with information on several movies. Use
      map on watchList to assign a new array of objects to the ratings variable.
      Each movie in the new array should have only a title key with the name of
      the film, and a rating key with the IMDB rating. The code in the editor
      currently uses a for loop to do this, so you should replace the loop
      functionality with your map expression.
    </p>

    <p>The watchList variable should not change.</p>

    <p>Your code should not use a for loop.</p>

    <p>Your code should use the map method.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        ratings should equal [{"title": "Inception", "rating": "8.8"}, {"title":
        "Interstellar", "rating": "8.6"}, {"title": "The Dark Knight", "rating":
        "9.0"},{"title": "Batman Begins", "rating": "8.3"}, {"title": "Avatar",
        "rating": "7.9"}].
      </li>
    </ul>
