    <h1>Use the filter Method to Extract Data from an Array</h1>
    <p>
      Another useful array function is Array.prototype.filter(), or simply
      filter().
    </p>

    <p>
      filter calls a function on each element of an array and returns a new
      array containing only the elements for which that function returns true.
      In other words, it filters the array, based on the function passed to it.
      Like map, it does this without needing to modify the original array.
    </p>

    <p>
      The callback function accepts three arguments. The first argument is the
      current element being processed. The second is the index of that element
      and the third is the array upon which the filter method was called.
    </p>

    <p>
      See below for an example using the filter method on the users array to
      return a new array containing only the users under the age of 30. For
      simplicity, the example only uses the first argument of the callback.
    </p>

    <p>
      const users = [ { name: 'John', age: 34 }, { name: 'Amy', age: 20 }, {
      name: 'camperCat', age: 10 } ];
    </p>

    <p>
      const usersUnder30 = users.filter(user => user.age < 30);
      console.log(usersUnder30); The console would display the value [ { name:
      'Amy', age: 20 }, { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 } ].
    </p>

    <p>
      The variable watchList holds an array of objects with information on
      several movies. Use a combination of filter and map on watchList to assign
      a new array of objects with only title and rating keys. The new array
      should only include objects where imdbRating is greater than or equal to
      8.0. Note that the rating values are saved as strings in the object and
      you may need to convert them into numbers to perform mathematical
      operations on them.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The watchList variable should not change.</li>

      <li>Your code should use the filter method.</li>

      <li>Your code should not use a for loop.</li>

      <li>
        filteredList should equal [{"title": "Inception", "rating": "8.8"},
        {"title": "Interstellar", "rating": "8.6"}, {"title": "The Dark Knight",
        "rating": "9.0"}, {"title": "Batman Begins", "rating": "8.3"}].
      </li>
    </ul>
